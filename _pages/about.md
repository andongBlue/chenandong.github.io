# Biography 
Andong Chen (陈安东) is a third-year Ph.D. candidate (2022-2026) at Harbin Institute of Technology (哈尔滨工业大学), China, advised by [Tiejun Zhao](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/zhaotiejun). Currently visiting Professor [Min Zhang](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/MinZhang)’s team (2022–Present) .He received his master's and bachelor's degree from  Queen Mary University/Minzu University of China and Hunan University. 

His research interests include nature language processing, large language model and machine translation. He has published 3 papers at the top international AI/NLP conferences/journal such as ACL, EMNLP and TALLIP. 

In open-source contributions, I like to share something that I think is valuable. Now I am the project leader of an open source project about LLMs([So Large Lm](https://github.com/datawhalechina/so-large-lm/tree/main)), which now has **4k starts 🌟**.

# News:

# Misc.
I hiked 30.8 kilometers of the [Silk Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road) in the summer after College Entrance Examination. I like the feeling of slowly moving forward and seeing the scenery along the way, and looking back to see how far I have moved forward. During college I enjoyed making friends and interacting with all differnet kinds of people. Communication has become a way for me to relax. I also like to communicate when I am alone, reading books and watching movies are the most common things I do.

For sports, I like swimming and badminton. I am recently learning cue sports.
