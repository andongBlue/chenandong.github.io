I am now a graduate student in NLP direction. I graduated from [Hunan University](http://www-en.hnu.edu.cn/) with an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation. My supervisor was Prof. [Zhigang Ling](http://eeit.hnu.edu.cn/info/1307/4568.htm) who start my research journey about Artificial Intelligence.

During my graduate studies, I was given the opportunity to go on an exchange to the UK. In China (2019/09-2020/01; 2022/02-2022/06), I researched on low resources language at the Monitoring Research Center at Minzu University of China, advised by  Prof. Xiaobing Zhao and  Prof. Yuan Sun. In the UK ( 2021/02-2022/01), I study Big Data at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/). During my stay in the UK, I am doing research on machine reading comprehension at [Computational Linguistics Lab](http://compling.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/), advised by Ph.D. candidate [Rosella Galindo Esparza](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oxqjNj8AAAAJ&hl=en).

Recently I am working on generative pre-trained language model at [ICT](http://english.ict.cas.cn/)(Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences), supervised by Prof. [Xishan Zhang](http://people.ucas.edu.cn/~zhangxishan?language=en). 

In open-source contributions, I like to open source what I think is valuable. Now I am the project leader of an open source project about data analysis([Hands-on data analysis](https://github.com/datawhalechina/hands-on-data-analysis/blob/master/README-English.md)), which now has **400 starts** and **163 forks**.

# Recent progress💡

1. Recently, I am working as a NLP Research Inter  at [ICT](http://english.ict.cas.cn/)(Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences), mainly working on **generative pre-trained language model**.
2. In collaboration with Rosella Galindo Esparza in [Queen Mary University of London](http://compling.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/), a paper is being written on low-resource machine reading comprehension. The paper will be submitted to **ACL**.

# Misc.
I hiked 30.8 kilometers of the [Silk Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road) in the summer after College Entrance Examination. I like the feeling of slowly moving forward and seeing the scenery along the way, and looking back to see how far I have moved forward. During college I enjoyed making friends and interacting with all differnet kinds of people. Communication has become a way for me to relax. I also like to communicate when I am alone, reading books and watching movies are the most common things I do.

For sports, I like swimming and badminton. I am recently learning cue sports.
